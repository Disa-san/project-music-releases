Music app

This is a music app showing new releases of songs, with links to the albums and artists. 

This was the first page I built using React. I used data from an API and with the help of .map extracted the information I wanted to include. I used CSS to style the page and to add SVG files as mock buttons.

I found several parts of this project very challenging and I do not feel that my finished product is completely finished. I feel that there are some basics to React that I still do not understand, like the linking of components and what information to put where. There is a lot of guessing and trial and error. In addition I struggled for a long time with the play button. I could only get it to not light up when hovering, or the whole album would light up when hovering over the icons. I decided to go with the first option and add a blur effect to the play button, to make it stand out more. All in all, I enjoyed working on the project.
